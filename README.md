My name is Marc, currently full-time student at 42 Barcelona school. After +15 years working as a leader in the Supply Chain/Transportation area for a BIG7, time had come for a big change!
I joined 42 Barcelona (https://www.42barcelona.com/es/) in June 2024, and loving the learning process :) I am currently in the Core Cursus for 42, mainly focusing on C and basic system admin. 
I'll be maintaining this github to expose my school projects and my owns, looking forward for your comments!
